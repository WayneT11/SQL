-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.
-- Finally, I explored the data using the following SQL.

-- #1. What is the average danceability by artist and track?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- #2. Who are the Top 10 Artists based on popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- #3. What artist released the longest song?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- #4. What artist released the shortest song?
SELECT artist_name, duration_ms
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC
LIMIT 1;

--  #5. What is the average duration of all the songs?
SELECT AVG(duration_ms)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- #6. What's the average danceability for the 10 most popular songs?
SELECT AVG(danceability)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE popularity >= 92
LIMIT 10;

-- #7. What is the average popularity, danceability and energy?
SELECT
AVG(popularity),
AVG(danceability),
AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;
